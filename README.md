# Expedia Code Academy - Python 102
## What
Welcome to Python 102. This course intends to explore Python in a slightly more rigourous manner than Python 101 in that most of the standard Python [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) will be covered providing students a solid background to start using Python in your own personal projects at Expedia and at home.
## Why Python?
Several reasons:

* It is a great beginner language. The learning curve is rather gentle. While it might not be "great" at everything, it is certainly a "decent" choice for most standard programming projects.
* In my opinion, Python is an excellent "glue" or "integration" language. It is very good at implementing Enterprise Integration Patterns like moving files around, interacting with databases, and passing data to and from message busses, and much, much more. Unlike C++ or Java, it does not need to be pre-compiled; rather, it is interpreted on the fly, which can lead to very quickly written tools (this may be a negative too...)
* Using standard frameworks, you can easily build up RESTful services, or build client APIs to consume RESTful services.
* For personal use, you can do all kinds of neat stuff like send text messages to people, build gaming servers, automatically open and close your garage door when certain things happen in your house, that sort of stuff.

## Why Not Python?

* Performance. Python is considerably slower than C++, Java, .NET, Go, and other precompiled languages. If performance is a concern, I would suggest looking to to one of the languages above
* Strict Object Oriented Programming. If, in your next project, you want strictly enforced interfaces, abstract base classes, accessors, etc., Python is not for you. That said, it does do OOO fairly well for a somewhat loosely-typed language.
* Asynchronous / Parallel programming. While there are libraries like Twisted that support taking advantage of all of your CPUs to do parallel computing, a better bet would be to take a look at something like Go or Erlang for this sort of thing.

## Who?
As mentioned, this course is aimed at students who already have some basic programming fundamentals covered.

Namely:

* You should be comfortable with some simple command line commands.
* You should be comfortable with an advanced text editor like Sublime Text, Atom, or perhaps an IDE like Visual Studio or IntelliJ IDEA.
* You should understand and be able to explain in a basic manner: boolean logic, loops, variable assignment, and strings.
* Finally, you should be curious (I don't like the word "passionate" very much) about and like to tinker with technology. Since you are already here, you get this one by default!

If you possess only some of those traits, not to worry. I can work with you and get you caught up. If most of the above sounds completely foreign to you, you might want to sign up for Python 101, or simply consider picking up a beginners book like [Learning Python](http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Edition-Mark-Lutz/dp/1449355730).

## Objectives
So, why are you ultimately here? That is, honestly a question you'll need to answer for yourself. 

My primary goal is to attempt to work through the basic online Python 3.5 tutorial, specifically focusing on Python programming best practices, or, writing "Pythonic" code. In this way, you will come out with a tool that you understand and can use to do all sorts of interesting things, in an elegant, readable, professional style!

Secondarily, I want you to write a lot of code. I'll be presenting some homework problems for you to work on, and while of course they aren't required, I'd really recommend you do them. You may have heard it over and over again, but practice makes perfect. And, once you practice for a solid eight weeks, it will be really easy to pick back up, even if you drop it for awhile.
